                    <strong>GOD DESCENDS</strong> INTO MANY 
                    <strong>PERSONS OF HIMSELF</strong>.</div>IN FACT IN THE FOUR BOOKS WHEN YOU SEE ANY 
                    <strong>NAME OF GOD</strong> ,EG IXOTE,HOLYSPIRIT,BANDS,YESHUA ETC,</div>THOUGH 
                    <b>GOD</b> IS 
                    <b>ONE</b>,AND THAT IS HOW 
                    <b>HE</b> WANTS YOU TO VIEW HIM,</div>ALL THOSE NAMES REPRESENTS A PERSON OF GOD WITH A PERSONALITY DIFFERENT
                    FROM ANOTHER PERSON OF GOD.(THIS IS A WHOLE NEW TOPIC WHICH I WILL WRITE ABOUT ANOTHER TIME)
                    <br /></div>
                  </div>HOWEVER THE VERY HIGHEST WHO CANNOT BE SEEN(WHO SITS BEHIND THE VEIL), 
                  <strong>WHO IS THE FIRST AND THE LAST</strong>,AND WHO IS 
                  <strong>ALL KNOWING</strong> AND WHOM 
                  <strong>EVERY PERSON OF GOD DESCENDED FROM</strong> AND WHO I WILL REFER TO AS</div>

                  <br />
                  <br /></div>ABRAHAM IS 
                  <strong>THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS</strong> IN HEAVEN,AND ALTHOUGH EVERYONE IN HEAVEN IS 33 YEARS OF
                  AGE,THE ELDERS ACTUALLY HAVE AN APPEARANCE OF 
                  <strong>120 YEAR OLD MEN</strong>,AND ABRAHAM HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A 
                  <strong>140 YEAR OLD MAN</strong>.</div>THE ELDERS HAVE WHITE HAIRS AND LONG WHITE BEARDS.</div>
                </div>ABRAHAM IS THE ONLY MAN IN HEAVEN WHO IS REFERRED TO AS 
                <strong>FATHER</strong>(ISAIAH 51:2).AND USUALLY ADDRESSED AS</div>
                <strong>FATHER ABRAHAM</strong> .EVEN BY THE ANGELS. AND HE IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS KING ABRAHAM .
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>ABRAHAM</strong> WHOSE NAME IN ALPHANUMERIC ADDS TO 
                <strong>44</strong>
                <br />LIKE THE NAME 
                <strong>GODHEAD</strong> WHO VISITED HIM (GENESIS 18:2)WHOSE ALPHANUMERIC IS ALSO 
                <strong>44</strong>,
                <br />IS SO BECAUSE;</div>
              </div>ABRAHAM INHERITED 
              <strong>WISDOM</strong> FROM 
              <b>THE FATHER</b>, 
              <strong>FAITH</strong> FROM 
              <b>THE HOLYSPIRIT</b> AND 
              <strong>LOVE</strong> FROM 
              <b>JESUS CHRIST</b> .
              <br />
              <br />THE ANGELS AND ALL IN HEAVEN TREAT HIM WITH A LOT OF RESPECT.
              <br /></div>PRINCE GABRIEL PARTICULARLY IS QUITE A GOOD FRIEND OF ABRAHAM,AND WILL USUALLY PASS BY HIS PALACE ON HIS
              WAY TO EARTH,JUST TO LET ABRAHAM KNOW THE ON GOINGS OF EARTH.
              <br /></div>
            </div>
          </div>ABRAHAM RESIDES IN THE NORTH KINGDOM,THE KINGDOM OF DAVID.
          <br /></div>
        </div>ABRAHAM CAN COME ON EARTH AS ABRAHAM,BUT IN THE TIME OF 
        <strong>JESUS</strong> CHRIST HE CAME AS LAZARUS(WHO WAS JESUS FRIEND,and WHOM JESUS RAISED FROM THE DEAD)</div>THAT IS WHY
        IN THE PARABLE JESUS GAVE OF THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS,JESUS SAYS THAT LAZARUS IN HEAVEN WAS IN ABRAHAM&#39;S BOSOM.Luke
